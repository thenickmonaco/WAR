WAR 1.0 License (2025) — Umbrella for Music & Software

Version 1.0
Purpose: To unify licensing for music and software under one project,
providing maximum freedom for music and copyleft protections for software,
while waiving attribution to the original author.

1. Scope
WAR 1.0 applies to the creative works of the project, including but not
limited to:
- Music (tracks, samples, compositions, remixes)
- Software (code, scripts, tools, applications)

2. License Terms by Work Type
2.1 Music
All music is licensed under CC0 (Creative Commons Zero).
Users may copy, remix, distribute, perform, or commercialize music without
attribution. No additional restrictions may be imposed.

2.2 Software
All software is licensed under AGPL-3.0 with Attribution Waiver.
Users may copy, modify, distribute, or execute the software, including over a
network. Derivatives must remain under WAR 1.0 (share-alike / copyleft).
Attribution to the original author is explicitly waived; users are not
required to credit the original author. No additional restrictions may be
imposed beyond those required to maintain open-source status.

3. General Terms
Users are legally bound to the license terms applicable to the type of work
they are using. This license does not restrict derivative works beyond the
copyleft requirements for software. The author disclaims all warranties; the
work is provided “as-is.”

4. Distribution
Include this WAR 1.0 umbrella license with every copy of your work.
Clearly indicate which portion of the work is music (CC0) and which is
software (AGPL-3.0 + attribution waiver).

5. Summary for Users
Music → Free to use, remix, commercialize, no credit required (CC0).
Software → Must remain open-source under WAR 1.0, but credit is optional
(AGPL-3.0 + Attribution Waiver).

This document serves as the official WAR 1.0 umbrella license. You can attach
it to your music, software, or future projects. It’s immediately effective;
no filings or approvals are required.
